### Add a feature
Want to implement a feature?
- Always check first whether someone has worked or is working on the feature.
- Make changes in a new branch
- When finished, commit your changes with an [appropriate commit message](chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Use `git rebase -i master` to squash multiple commits into a single one and ensure your changes are ahead of `master`
- Push your changes to the repository
- Open a pull request for your branch onto `master`
- When changes are requested, make them in your branch and rebase it into a single commit ahead of `master`
- When your pull request is accepted, make sure to delete your branch locally and remotely
